      <h2>JavaScript programming language!</h2>
      <p> <b>JavaScript</b> was invented by Brendan Eich in 1995. It was developed for Netscape 2, and became the ECMA-262 standard in 1997.
After Netscape handed JavaScript over to ECMA, the Mozilla foundation continued to develop JavaScript for the Firefox browser. Mozilla's latest version was 1.8.5. (Identical to ES5).</p>

      <p>Internet Explorer (IE4) was the first browser to support ECMA-262 Edition 1 (ES1).</p>
      <p><i>ECMA - European Computer Manufacturers Association,after 1994, when the organization became global, the “trademark” “Ecma” was kept for historical reasons.</i></p>

    <h1>Article 2 </h1>

      <h2>The ECMA Technical Committee 39</h2>
      <p>In 1996, Netscape and Brendan Eich took JavaScript to the ECMA international standards organization, and a technical committee (TC39) was created to develop the language. ECMA-262 Edition 1 was released in June 1997.</p>
      <h2>From ES4 to ES6</h2>
      <p>Ihen the TC39 committee got together in Oslo in 2008, to agree on ECMAScript 4, they were divided into 2 very different camps:

The ECMAScript 3.1 Camp:
Microsoft and Yahoo who wanted an incremental upgrade from ES3.

The ECMAScript 4 Camp:
Adobe, Mozilla, Opera, and Google who wanted a massive ES4 upgrade.

August 13 2008, Brendan Eich wrote an email:

It's no secret that the JavaScript standards body, Ecma's Technical Committee 39, has been split for over a year, with some members favoring ES4, a major fourth edition to ECMA-262, and others advocating ES3.1 based on the existing ECMA-262 Edition 3 (ES3) specification. Now, I'm happy to report, the split is over.

The solution was to work together:

ECMAScript 4 was renamed to ES5
ES5 should be an incremental upgrade of ECMAScript 3.
Features of ECMAScript 4 should be picked up in later versions.
TC39 should develop a new major release, bigger in scope than ES5.
The planned new release (ES6) was codenamed "Harmony" (Because of the split it created?).

ES5 was a huge success. It was released in 2009, and all major browsers (including Internet Explorer) were fully compliant by July 2013.
ES6 was also a huge success. It was released in 2015, and all major browsers were fully compliant by March 2017.</p>
